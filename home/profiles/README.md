# Home Manager Profiles

Profiles define what software a user USES (package sets, applications, configs).

Each profile file (developer.nix, desktop.nix, etc.) contains:

- Package installations
- Application configurations
- User interface settings
- Workflow tools

Profiles are COMPREHENSIVE software collections for specific user types.
